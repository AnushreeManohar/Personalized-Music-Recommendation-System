1. First step is to download the dataset from the link provided above 

2. Second step is to install all the libraries provided in the code.

3. Update the dataset path before you run the program to your local system with proper .csv name

4. Run the chunks to generate the outputs. You will find Data Analysis, main model for recommendation system and some machine learning algorithms implemented in the order mentioned.

5. We also have my sql part which was done using Databricks. So, we have a separate file for the same.

## Known bugs

1. You would not get recommendations if your song name and Listening_Period doesn't match the name and Listening_Period in the dataset.

## Troubleshooting

1. Make sure the name of the song and Listening_Period you provide for recommending song is same in the dataset.
For reference, we have generated the Listening_Period in the recommendation dictionary, which you can use as a reference for the next recommendation.

## Running the Program

1. As the file submitted is ipynb file, you can run this on jupyter notebook, also the dataset is large. So, it might take come time for execution.
